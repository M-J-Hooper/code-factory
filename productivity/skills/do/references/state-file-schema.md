## Problem Statement

## Codebase Map

### Entry Points
- `path/to/file:function` - Description

### Main Execution Call Path
- `caller` → `callee` → `next` (describe the flow)

### Key Types/Functions
- `path/to/file:Type` - Description
- `path/to/file:function` - Description

### Integration Points
- Where to add new functionality
- Existing patterns to follow

### Conventions
- Naming patterns, file organization, testing patterns

### Risk Areas
- Complex or fragile code requiring careful changes

## Findings (facts only)
- (Bullets; each includes `file:symbol` or `MCP:<tool> → <result>` or `websearch:<url> → <result>`)
- (Facts only - no assumptions here)

## Hypotheses (if needed)
- H1: <hypothesis> - <evidence supporting it>
- H2: <hypothesis> - <evidence supporting it>
- (Clearly marked as hypotheses, not facts)

## Solution Direction

### Approach
- (Strategic direction: what pattern/strategy, which components affected)
- (High-level only - NO pseudo-code or code snippets)
- (YES: module names, API/pattern names, data flow descriptions)

### Why This Approach
- (Brief rationale - what makes this the right choice)

### Alternatives Rejected
- (What other options were considered? Why not chosen?)

### Complexity Assessment
- **Level**: Low / Medium / High
- (1-2 sentences on what drives the complexity)

### Key Risks
- (What could go wrong? Areas needing extra attention)

## Research Brief

## File Impact Map

| File | Change Type | Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | New / Modify / Extend / Delete | Low / Medium / High | Brief description |

Change types:
- **New**: File created from scratch
- **Modify**: Existing file, changing behavior
- **Extend**: Existing file, adding capability without changing existing behavior
- **Delete**: Removing file or significant code block

## Milestones

### M-001: <Milestone Name>
**Scope**: What exists after this milestone
**Verification**: How to prove it works
**Dependencies**: What must be true before starting

### M-002: <Milestone Name>
...

## Task Breakdown

### Milestone M-001

Each task MUST be broken into bite-sized steps (one action per step). Tasks introducing new behavior MUST follow TDD-first structure. NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.

- [ ] T-001 (M-001) Task description
  - Files: `path/to/file.ts` (New/Modify), `tests/path/to/file.test.ts` (New/Modify)
  - Risk: Low | Medium | High
  - Steps (TDD-first — mandatory for behavior changes):
    1. Write failing test (include complete test code — not "add a test for X")
    2. Run test → `<exact command>` → expected: FAIL with `<specific error message>`
    3. Implement minimal code to pass (include complete code or precise file:line edit instructions)
    4. Run test → `<exact command>` → expected: PASS (and all existing tests still pass)
    5. Commit → `<commit message>`
  - Acceptance: What "done" looks like (observable behavior, not internal state)
- [ ] T-002 (M-001) Task description
  - Depends on: T-001
  - Risk: Medium
  - Steps: (TDD-first when behavior changes; direct edit → verify → commit for config/refactor)
  - Acceptance: What "done" looks like

### Milestone M-002
- [ ] T-003 (M-002) ...

## Integration Points
- (List boundaries this change touches: APIs, file formats, inter-component contracts)
- (Flag any breaking changes or version considerations)

## Risk Guidelines

| Risk Level | When to Apply | Execution Approach |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Low | Simple changes, additive, well-understood patterns | Execute normally |
| Medium | Multiple files, API interactions, state changes | Review code paths before committing |
| High | Security, data migrations, core logic changes | Think through ALL edge cases before writing code |

## Validation Strategy

### Existing Test Coverage
- (What existing tests already validate parts of this?)

### New Tests Required

| Test Name | Type | File | Description |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| test_name | Unit / Integration / E2E | path or "new file" | What it verifies |

### Test Infrastructure Changes
- [ ] None required
- [ ] Extending existing test framework
- [ ] Adding new test files to existing framework
- [ ] Significant test infrastructure changes (describe)

### Per-Milestone Validation
- M-001: Command to run, expected output
- M-002: Command to run, expected output

### Final Acceptance
- [ ] Criterion 1: How to verify
- [ ] Criterion 2: How to verify

## Assumptions
- (List assumptions made during planning that could be wrong)
- (These become verification points before/during implementation)

## Open Questions
- (Questions that must be answered before implementing specific tasks)
- (Flag which task is blocked by each question)

## Recovery and Idempotency

### Safe to Repeat
- Tasks that can run multiple times

### Requires Care
- Tasks with side effects

### Rollback Plan
- How to revert if needed
